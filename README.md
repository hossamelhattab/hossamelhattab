One of my achievement is my bachelor project where I created a 3D Virtual environment that is a Supermarket using Unity that is VR compatible that adapts and changes its entire layout depending on the user and their preferences by storing the user’s data on the cloud based on their interactions on the virtual layout, and in the end earned an excellent grade.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭:
I graduated from GUC (German University in Cairo). I spent part of my academics in Germany, Berlin, living independently, so I can deal with different people with different languages and cultures in any country/area.
Although I am an IT eng. but I am also keen to learn more about finance & business cycle which are crucial for program analysis.
I always follow up on new changes and requirements in the field (e.g Cyber Security, AI).
